Many people are attracted to cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity. With any investment portfolio, diversification is one of the keys to managing risk.

The raw data is collected in a spreadsheet and then converted into a MindMap for visualisation and consumption.

Community members submit new coins for inclusion in a certain category as well as submitting corrections when a coin has been misspelled, misplaced or no longer exists.
